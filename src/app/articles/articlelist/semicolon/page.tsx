          A little history behind the semicolon: <br />
          A really smart guy named Aldus Manutius the Elder (1449-1515) was an
          Italian humanist and printer from the Italian Renaissance who
          established the grammar practice of using the semicolon to separate
          words of opposed meaning and to indicate interdependent statements.{" "}
          <br />
          To put it bluntly, the semicolon serves to relate your ideas in your
          writing with a sense of style and sophistication. <br />
          <p className={styles.secondcontent}>
            Aldus Manutius <br />
            Many writers today may avoid the semicolon because they don’t think
            it is a necessary part of grammar structure. Many people just plain
            don’t know how to use it! <br />
            At Exemplary English, we do not balk in fear at that which we don’t
            understand. <br />
            I hope to eliminate the fear of this peculiar little punctuation by
            familiarizing learners with its basic rules and functions. Remember,
            all good writers sometimes struggle with even the most basic
            punctuation. <br />
            But don’t give up! Keep practicing and you’ll get it!

          <p className={styles.secondcontent}>
            How to effectively use a semicolon:
          </p>
          <p className={styles.secondcontent}>
            “The principal of the school came by our class today. He was kind of
            scary.”
          </p>
          <p className={styles.fourthcontentarticle2}>

          </p>
          <p className={styles.secondcontent}>
            Take a moment to read these two sentences aloud. Did you get the
            pause between the two ideas? Because these two sentences are
            separated by a period, it’s indicated that the reader must pause
            between the two statements.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.secondcontent}>
            Now read this sentence: <br />
            “The principal of our school came by our class today; he was kind of
            scary.” <br />
            Did you say the sentence without completely pausing? If so, that
            justifies the semicolon’s most basic function. <br />
            Remember that the period prompts a full pause whereas the semi-colon
            prompts a more casual pause. <br />
            Rule #1:  If you have two interdependent clauses (two sentences that
            can “stand” alone without depending on each other), then it is okay
            to use a semicolon. <br />
            “The principal came by our class today; he was kind of scary.”{" "}
            <br />
            (This clause can stand alone)            (This clause can stand
            alone)
          </p>
          <p className={styles.secondcontent}>
            Remember that a conjunction is the part of speech that connects two
            words, sentences, phrases or clauses together.  Hence… <br />
            Rule #2:  We DO NOT use semicolons with conjunctions. <br />
            “The principal came to our class today, but he looked really scary.”{" "}
            <br />
            We would never write: “The principal came to our class today; but he
            looked really scary.” <br />
            (In the first example, the comma is used because there is a but
            separating the two clauses.)
          </p>
          <p className={styles.secondcontent}>
            Rule #3: DO use a semicolon before conjunctive adverbs and
            transitional phrases that join independent clauses. <br />
            Now hold on! Didn’t we just say not to use semicolons with
            conjunctions??? <br />
            Yes we did. But a conjunctive adverb is slightly different than a
            conjunction. <br />
            An adverb is a word that changes or qualifies the meaning of a verb,
            adjective, other adverb, clause, sentence or any other word or
            phrase. <br />
            Example: <br />
            Mike worked very carefully on his paper. (Carefully shows how he did
            his paper.)
          </p>
          <p className={styles.secondcontent}>
            Some commonly used adverbs include but are not limited to: <br />
            carefully <br />
            correctly <br />
            eagerly <br />
            easily <br />
            fast <br />
            loudly <br />
            patiently <br />
            quickly <br />
            quietly, 
            <br />
            and <br />
            well. <br />
            As we mentioned above, a conjunction is a part of speech that
            connects two words, sentences, phrases or clauses together. (See
            example above) <br />
            Conjunctional adverbs are adverbs that show a transition between
            ideas within a sentence. <br />
            Example: <br />
            Emily enjoys old video games; therefore, she is a crazy nerd.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.fourthcontentarticle2}>

          </p>
          <p className={styles.secondcontent}>
            Other commonly used conjunctional adverbs include but are not
            limited to: <br />
            Also, consequently, conversely, finally, furthermore, hence,
            however, meanwhile, moreover, nevertheless, nonetheless, otherwise,
            similarly, subsequently, therefore, thus.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.secondcontent}>
            Did you notice the semicolon in the above example? Now what would
            happen if we took it out? <br />
            Example: <br />
            Emily enjoys old video games therefore, she is a crazy nerd. <br />
            Doesn’t quite look and sound right does it? <br />
            Example: <br />
            Emily enjoys old video games; therefore, she is a crazy nerd.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.secondcontent}>Ah, much better…. </p>
          <p className={styles.secondcontent}>
            You should note two things. First, the sentences joined by the
            semicolons are closely related in theme, which is the fundamental
            rule of semicolon placement. Second, note that the semicolon is
            placed before the conjunctive adverb or transitional phrase.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.secondcontent}>
            Rule # 4: To ensure that your sentence is clear, use a semicolon
            between items that contain internal (inside) punctuation. <br />
            Compare these two examples and see if you can note the difference.{" "}
            <br />
            Example # 1: <br />
            In his adventure in Super Mario Land, Mario battled Koopas with
            sunglasses, fire flowers, Bob-ombs and turtle shells, Princess Peach
            battled using her pink parasol and high heels, the Koopas fought
            back by bouncing, spinning and rolling on top of him. <br />
            There are quite A LOT of commas in there, aren’t there? Makes it a
            bit hard to read clearly, doesn’t it?  This is grammatically
            incorrect, a run-on sentence. <br />
            So let’s rewrite the sentence using what we’ve learned from rule #4:{" "}
            <br />
            In his adventure in Super Mario Land, Mario fought Koopas with
            sunglasses, fire flowers, Bob-ombs and turtle shells; Princess Peach
            battled using her pink parasol and high heels; the Koopas fought
            back by bouncing, spinning and rolling on top of him. <br />
            Seems a bit clearer doesn’t it? Go get em’ Mario! <br />
            One final note: If you still are confused by semicolons and their
            purpose in grammar, try to visualize semicolons as your favorite
            hamburger topping. You wouldn’t want to put way too much ketchup,
            relish or mustard on your burger, would you? It would make it rather
            hard to eat and enjoy. It would be messy and the taste would not be
            very good. Remember, just as condiments complement your burger’s
            taste, so should a semicolon complement your writing.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.secondcontent}>
            Do you want this burger your way? <br />
            Don’t let semicolons overpower your writing. As condiments and
            spices bring flavor and variety to food, so should the semicolon.{" "}
            <br />
            Now if you excuse me, I’m off to a summer barbecue for a tasty
            burger! <br />
            Happy Writing,
