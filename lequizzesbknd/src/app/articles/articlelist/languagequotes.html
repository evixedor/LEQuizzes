Famous Quotes About Language….

“He who does not love his own language is worse than an animal and smelly fish.”  (Jose Rizal)

“If the English language made any sense, lackadaisical would have something to do with a shortage of flowers.”  (Doug Larson)

“Language is the blood of the soul into which thoughts run and out of which they grow.”  (Oliver Wendell Holmes)

“Language ought to be the joint creation of poets and manual workers.”  (George Orwell)
