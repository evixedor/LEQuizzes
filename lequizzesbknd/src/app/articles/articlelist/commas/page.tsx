					<div className={styles.text1}>The Long and Short of It: Commas</div>
					<div className={styles.text2}>by Jillian Torassa</div>
				</h1>
				<p className={styles.secondcontent}>
					Here are the rules of “The Comma,” as far as I’ve come to understand
					them: <br />
					List, Series of Three or More, Oxford comma <br />
					I brought Jell-O, baseball gloves, bug spray, and napkins to the
					picnic. <br />
					Now, sometimes you don’t need the final comma between “spray” and
					“napkin,” but it’s safer just to add one anyway. If you don’t (or if
					your list is too complicated), your reader might think that “bug
					spray” and “napkins” go together like “rock and roll.” It’s never
					wrong to write that last comma before the “and,” so just make it a
					habit to always use it. <br />
					Before a Conjunction <br />
					I brought Jell-O to the picnic, but it turns out that someone else
					brought it. <br />
					Here, you put a comma in front of a conjunction (but, and, yet, for,
					nor, or, so), but ONLY IF both clauses are independent. <br />
					I brought Jell-O to the picnic. <br />
					There is a subject (I) and a verb (brought), so this is a complete
					sentence. Of course “brought” is a transitive verb, which means it
					needs an object (Jell-O) to make it complete, but that’s a lesson for
					a different time. <br />
					It turns out that someone else brought it. <br />
					This is also a complete sentence/clause. There is a subject (someone
					else) and a verb (brought). This object of brought is “it.” <br />
					Because these two parts of the sentence are complete, you put a comma
					before a conjunction. <br />
					 When You Don’t Put it Before a Conjunction <br />
					I brought Jell-O to the picnic and ate all of it. <br />
					If one of parts (clauses) of the sentence is incomplete, then you do
					not put a comma before the conjunction. <br />
					Ate all of it is not a complete sentence. There is no subject attached
					to the verb (ate). So, YOU DO NOT ADD A COMMA. This is maybe one of
					the most commonly made mistakes as far as commas go, and it could be a
					hard rule to master. But it’s important that you keep practicing until
					you get it, so you can avoid comma splices (unnecessary commas).{" "}
					<br />
					Setting off Introductory Elements <br />
					Yesterday, I brought Jell-O to the picnic. <br />
					Sometimes, you don’t need the comma after an introductory phrase (like
					yesterday, however, unfortunately,  yes, or anything else like that),
					but it is never incorrect to add one. So just do it. It will only
					clarify your work. <br />
					What is an introductory phrase? <br />
					An adverbial clause — an adverb clarifies a verb. Although the Jell-O
					was quickly gone, I’m glad I brought it. “Quickly” is an adverb
					describing “was gone,” which is the verb. <br />
					Absolute phrases — Jiggling happily in the breeze, the Jell-O looked
					very inviting. <br />
					Or infinitive phrases (with to) — In order to bring Jell-O, I had to
					go buy some at the store first. <br />
					Setting of Parenthetical Elements <br />
					I brought Jell-O, my favorite dessert, to the picnic. <br />
					“My favorite dessert” is a parenthetical thought (a thought that isn’t
					absolutely necessary for the sentence to make sense), an interjection,
					or a phrase that interrupts sentence flow. <br />
					I brought Jell-O to the picnic is a complete sentence all on its own,
					but you wanted to add another thought (Jell-O is your favorite
					dessert). So, you take the parenthetical statement, and you set it
					apart by two commas. <br />
					Sometimes, with parenthetical elements, you do not need to put a comma
					after a conjunction, even if both clauses are independent: I wanted to
					bring Jell-O, but frankly, I didn’t have any sugar. You don’t need to
					put a comma after “but” because “but frankly” is a parenthetical
					phrase. <br />
					Now, if you wanted to just write I wanted to bring Jell-O, but I
					didn’t have any sugar, you still need a comma, because then it’s
					simply two independent clauses separated by a conjunction. <br />
					Coordinate Adjectives <br />
					I brought Jell-O to the clean, safe, well-kept park. <br />
					If you could put an “and” in between any of those adjectives (The park
					was clean AND safe AND well-kept), then you use a comma to separate
					them. <br />
					Since you probably wouldn’t say “I brought Jell-O to the safe and
					clean park,” (it’s grammatically correct, but awkward) you should
					replace the “and” with a comma.’ <br />
					Typographical <br />
					I brought Jell-O to the picnic on March 5, 2003, in Los Angeles,
					California. There were 2,560 people there. My boss, Harold Smith, CEO
					of Work Space, really liked it. <br />
					See all those commas? You use one after dates, between cities and
					states, within large numbers, and to separate a name from a title, if
					the title comes after the name. <br />
					Don’t use a comma if any part of the full date is omitted (March
					2003), or if you use military format (5 March 2003), but use it in all
					other typographical situations. <br />
					Phrases That Express Contrast <br />
					The Jell-o was hot, not cold. <br />
					See what I did there? <br />
					Setting off Quotes <br />
					I believe it was Ben Franklin who said, “Jell-O is the fruit of all
					life.” <br />
					If the quote is part of the sentence (I brought Jell-O, even though I
					don’t think it’s “the fruit of all life” or I believe it was Ben
					Franklin who said THAT “Jell-O is the fruit of all life.”), then you
					don’t need to separate it with a comma. Other than that, you separate
					quotes from your own writing using a comma. <br />
					Separate a Statement from a Question <br />
					I can bring Jell-O, can’t I? <br />
					Remember, the point of punctuation is to make it easier for your
					reader to get across your exact meaning <br />
					Think of this: <br />
					<br />
					<p className={styles.secondcontent}>
						A lot of commas are unnecessary, but they are totally necessary if
						you need help clarifying. You just have to learn the rules. <br />
						Here is one last tip: Read your work OUT LOUD! I know you’ll feel
						like a crazy person, but just do it. It really helps, especially if
						you read slowly. Or, better yet, have a roommate, BFF, brother,
						someone you want to punish…anyone, really, read it to you. Then,
						mark the spots where they stumble. This not only helps you recognize
						awkward wording and flow issues, but also helps you understand where
						there should (or shouldn’t) be commas. Remember—commas = pauses. You
						can recognize pauses best when you hear them. Still, a pause in
						reading isn’t always an appropriate time to use a comma, so if
						you’re prone to comma-over-usage, learn the rules instead. <br />
						Yeah, it’s complicated. But you’ll become a better writer as soon as
						you learn the proper use for commas.
