          At face-value, the intensity with which teachers hit the issue of
          punctuation may seem futile. After all, there are plenty of famous
          authors who break the rules all the time. But students do not
          appreciate the impact that this groan-inspiring word has on written
          communication with their fellow human beings, and those authors can’t
          break the rules without first knowing what they are. Students do not
          realize that punctuation is essential. Don’t believe me? Try living
          without it. Content is pointless if the meaning is confused or
          unclear. Punctuation is crucial to clarifying ideas and can be divided
          into several different marks that range from the most basic, such as
          the common period, to the more advanced, such as the
          less-easily-understood colon. <br />
          With a growing sense of dread the students watched as the chalk
          screeched over the dark surface of the chalk board morale sank with
          every letter that Ms Eck wrote on the board first a p then a u by the
          time the n and c were revealed they knew that they were doomed there
          was no escaping it was time to learn about the worlds most boring
          subject punctuation <br />
          Not so easy to read, is it? For most native English speakers, it is
          possible to get the gist of this passage, but its meaning can still be
          clarified, simplified, and enhanced by adding a few extra marks here
          and there. While not every possible punctuation mark is represented in
          this paper, the above paragraph is still a prime example of why we
          need punctuation. I will share how to fix it. <br />
          The Period <br />
          This is the most rudimentary of punctuation marks, yet it has a myriad
          of jobs. Not only does it end thoughts, but it also is used to end
          abbreviations or to follow letters and numbers in outlines or lists.{" "}
          <br />
          Without a period at the end, a sentence just isn’t a sentence.
          Thoughts go on and on and there is no way of breaking up flow. Reading
          a paper with an absence of periods is like listening to a very fast
          speaker talk on and on without taking a break. It is not only
          annoying, but also very confusing and tiring. <br />
          With a growing sense of dread the students watched as the chalk
          screeched over the dark surface of the chalk board. Morale sank with
          every letter that Ms. Eck wrote on the board. First a p then a u. By
          the time the n and c were revealed they knew that they were doomed.
          There was no escaping it. It was time to learn about the worlds most
          boring subject punctuation. <br />
          Compared to the first draft, this makes much more sense. But the above
          paragraph still leaves much to be desired. Ideas are still unclear.
          There is another punctuation mark that is almost as elementary as the
          period, but when used correctly, makes a world of difference. <br />
          The Apostrophe <br />
          Take a look at the fifth to last word of our example. Are there
          multiple worlds? Or does the most boring subject belong to it? The
          apostrophe is a useful punctuation mark that answers these questions.
          It is used to show possession. <br />
          If the most boring subject belonged to multiple worlds, it would look
          like this: worlds’. If it belonged only to the one world, it would
          look like this: world’s. This is an easy enough concept to grasp and
          an easy enough correction to make. But now the meaning of the sentence
          is clear. <br />
          With a growing sense of dread the students watched as the chalk
          screeched over the dark surface of the chalk board. Morale sank with
          every letter that Ms. Eck wrote on the board. First a p then a u. By
          the time the n and c were revealed they knew that they were doomed.
          There was no escaping it. It was time to learn about the world’s most
          boring subject punctuation. <br />
          The apostrophe is also used in contractions: “do not” becomes “don’t.”
          It is not “dont.” “Dont” is not a word, nor is it short for two words.
          It is simply incorrect. This, however, is not a correction in our
          example, so I will not say anymore about it here. <br />
          Now we know that the most boring subject belongs to the world. But
          what is with all the random letters in the third sentence? That choice
          of random letters doesn’t make any sense. Not yet, anyway. <br />
          Quotation Marks <br />
          Quotation marks are yet another form of punctuation, and they are,
          like all other marks, used to clarify thoughts and intent. These
          little marks, which come in pairs surrounding a piece of text, are
          present to set apart a section of writing for a variety of purposes.{" "}
          <br />
          The most common of these purposes is to indicate dialogue, but
          quotation marks also surround slang words, set apart the title of a
          short written work or a piece of a longer work, and indicate an
          explicit definition. <br />
          With quotation marks, the account of Ms. Eck’s class makes even more
          sense and continues to get easier to read: <br />
          With a growing sense of dread the students watched as the chalk
          screeched over the dark surface of the chalk board. Morale sank with
          every letter that Ms. Eck wrote on the board. First a “p” then a “u”.
          By the time the “n” and “c” were revealed they knew that they were
          doomed. There was no escaping it. It was time to learn about the
          world’s most boring subject punctuation. <br />
          Now that the purpose of these single letters, such as “p” and “n”, are
          better understood, the paragraph is approaching grammatically-correct
          excellence, though there are still some crucial things missing. The
          next correction we are about to make is not an easy concept for most
          students. There are many rules to remember and many possible mistakes
          to make, but when mastered, this piece of punctuation is the most
          useful mark in writing. <br />
          The Comma <br />
          Arguably, the comma is the most frequently used punctuation mark in
          the English language. It is used to show a pause, a list, an
          introductory phrase…the list goes on and on. <br />
          Commas make the written word more interesting. Imagine that all of the
          sentences in the world had the same structure. That would get very
          boring to read. There is no variance in length. There is no variance
          in construction. Every sentence would be simple. How boring! <br />
          What happens when we add commas to our writing? Suddenly, the reader
          is more interested in what is being said. We can combine simple
          sentences, and there is variety. Not only have our sentences become
          more diverse, bur also we can now make a list here, and we can have an
          introductory phrase there. These add emphasis and further help make a
          point. Above all, though, commas clarify our ideas. <br />
          With a growing sense of dread, the students watched as the chalk
          screeched over the dark surface of the chalk board. Morale sank with
          every letter that Ms. Eck wrote on the board. First a “p” then a “u”.
          By the time the “n” and “c” were revealed, they knew that they were
          doomed. There was no escaping it. It was time to learn about the
          world’s most boring subject punctuation. <br />
          Suddenly, we start to really understand this paragraph. The general
          idea has always been apparent, but we can now read it more easily.
          Introductory phrases can be read as they are supposed to be read
          rather than as the beginning of another simply-structured sentence.{" "}
          <br />
          But why did we not put a comma after the word “subject” in the last
          sentence? Ah ha! This is one of the “comma traps” most people are
          prone to fall into. A comma here would not be correct, but the
          sentence still feels awkward. <br />
          Have no fear! We can fix it yet! <br />
          The Colon <br />
          The colon is one of the most sophisticated marks of punctuation. Its
          function often seems incomprehensible and is shied away from, but it
          can be very handy once it is understood. It can be used to create
          lists, to indicate a quotation, and to separate two independent
          clauses. <br />
          Mostly, it is used to attract attention to an idea and to add
          emphasis. In this case, a colon follows a label that identifies “the
          world’s most boring subject.” <br />
          With a growing sense of dread, the students watched as the chalk
          screeched over the dark surface of the chalk board. Morale sank with
          every letter that Ms. Eck wrote on the board. First a “p” then a “u”.
          By the time the “n” and “c” were revealed, they knew that they were
          doomed. There was no escaping it. It was time to learn about the
          world’s most boring subject: punctuation. <br />
          Now, the paragraph is perfect. Finally, our little story is properly
          punctuated. It makes so much more sense now. It feels right. <br />
          With a growing sense of dread, the students watched as the chalk
          screeched over the dark surface of the chalk board. Morale sank with
          every letter that Ms. Eck wrote on the board. First a “p” then a “u”.
          By the time the “n” and “c” were revealed, they knew that they were
          doomed. There was no escaping it. It was time to learn about the
          world’s most boring subject: punctuation. <br />
          After a long and boring lesson, the students finally made it out to
          recess. <br />
          “That was dumb,” said little Susie. <br />
          “Yeah. Like we’re ever going to have to use any of that!” agreed
          Quentin. <br />
          Mary scowled in defiance. “Punctuation is awesome, you dummy-head!
          You’ll see…someday you’ll wish you had listened during that lesson.”
