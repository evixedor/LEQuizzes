          As essay-writers, we can sometimes assume that the importance of our
          writing lies solely in the words we use. We can sometimes get lost in
          the moment and create page after page of what looks like pure genius.{" "}

          You go to class, hand your paper in, and spend the rest of class
          daydreaming about the large A+ adorning the top of your masterpiece…{" "}
          <br />
          The next day, you strut into your classroom like a conquistador and
          sit down at your desk expecting nothing but praise for your wonderful
          work. <br />
          But… <br />

            You look down and there are the dreaded red circles EVERYWHERE!{" "}
            <br />
            They mass over your paper, they taunt you, and they turn your blood
            cold. You wonder why a magnum opus such as yours failed to impress.{" "}
            <br />
            After all, you worked so hard on it! <br />
            Thankfully, you wake up from your nightmare in a cold sweat. It must
            have been the pepperoni pizza last night. But then you remember that
            your paper is in fact due that very afternoon! <br />

            In a panic, you rush to your computer and log into Exemplary English
            to learn about the importance of PUNCTUATION! If you are like me,
            you’ve been so deep into your writing that you sometimes forget
            those important little dots, dashes and exclamations. Now, if you’ve
            ever gotten a paper back from a teacher with all those little red
            circles, don’t worry!  Everybody has received them NUMEROUS TIMES in
            their learning experience. As a home-schooler, my mom was my English
            teacher and let me tell you, she didn’t go soft on me when I forgot
            my commas or periods. I had plenty of red circles on papers, but you
            know what happened? I just got better with my writing as I learned
            more about the importance of punctuation, you will too as you learn
            more about writing and grammar.

            So just why do we punctuate? Take this sentence for example. “Come
            and eat people.” Wait WHAT!? You want me to eat WHAT?!!
          </p>
          <p className={styles.secondcontent}>
            Now read this sentence. “Come and eat, people.” See how much
            difference the two makes?

            Now unless you are part of a pride of hungry lions, the first
            sentence does look a little strange doesn’t it? <br />
            But if you look at the second sentence, it is the same sentence, but
            it seems more like a casual call for dinner doesn’t it? <br />
            When we speak, we have many ways to show our communication when we
            are talking to someone. <br />
            But with regards to writing, we need to have a way to show the
            different emotions, feelings, actions etc. when expressing our
            communication to the reader. There is a lot more elaboration when we
            speak, raise or lower our voice, stress words, pause, repeat and
            even when we use hand signals and motions. <br />
            Punctuation is the only thing we’ve got when writing. Fully
            understanding punctuation is vital when trying to get your point
            across in your paper. <br />
            Here are a few helpful tips that I would like to share with you that
            helped me over the years to remember my punctuation. <br />
            Run-on sentences: This was a common mistake that I would make when I
            was young and learning to write. A run-on sentence is two or more
            complete sentences without punctuation or conjunction. This can
            happen when you have a lot to say but don’t know how to break it
            down without leaving something important out. For instance, here is
            an example of a run-on sentence. <br />
            My car is out of gas we need to get it to the gas station before it
            gets dark. <br />
            Now this is not a long run-on, but the person writing it seems a bit
            out of breath.
          </p>

            Now try this. My car is out of gas. We need to get it to the gas
            station before it gets dark. Hear the difference?

            Funny Bad Grammar Fact: In the short science fiction story “”Repent,
            Harlequin!” Said the Ticktockman” by Harlan Ellison, there is an
            infamous paragraph that is almost entirely a run-on sentence. About
            what you may ask? It’s about jelly beans! If you are interested in
            reading the whole story you can find it by copying and pasting this

            <div>
              Apostrophes: The apostrophe is used to form possessives. In other
              words, it signifies what or who something belongs to. For
              instance, Emily’s house, Ellen’s car, Mike’s computer, or
              Ranjeeth’s pizza. It is also used as a contraction, which means
              words that have a letter or some letters omitted, or taken out in
              order to combine two words together. For instance, I cannot
              becomes I can’t, I have not becomes I haven’t etc. Be careful!
              Don’t use apostrophes in possessive pronouns or plural nouns. For
              instance for possessive pronouns, the incorrect usage of
              apostrophes would be their’s, her’s, it’s, your’s.  Correct usage
              is theirs, hers, its, and yours.  For plural nouns, the incorrect
              usage would be as follows: video game’s, pizza’s and playground’s.
              The correct usage would be: video games, pizzas and playgrounds.

              COMMAS! Dear me, this little period with a tail was one of my
              biggest grammar foes while growing up! Sometimes I would put too
              many in, sometimes I’d forget them entirely! <br />
              There are many appropriate rules for using commas. Here are a
              couple that I’ll point out for you. <br />
              a) If you like to make lists, you’ve often used commas to separate
              your items. Use commas to separate three or more words in a list.{" "}
              <br />
              My Camping Checklist: Remember to pack up tent, food, sleeping
              bag, towels and my toothbrush. <br />
              b) The basic compound sentence. <br />
              Emily watched a movie, and Mike read a book. <br />
              c) Introductions. You should use commas when using introductory
              words or phrases. <br />
              Dear Exemplary English, thank you for your help. <br />

          In conclusion, punctuation is an important part of the writing
          process. While it may be tough to remember all the certain rules, keep
          in mind that even if you forget a period or a comma every so often,
          it’s all about the joy and pleasure of learning. Don’t give up! We
          here at Exemplary English encourage you to check out our website
          articles, games, videos, or courses or tutoring for more help. If you
          need more help or have any more questions about punctuation, leave a
