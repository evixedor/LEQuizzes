				“Who and Whom” by Emily Zeller These two words can be so confusing to
				even the seasoned writer. I mean really? How many of us use the word
				whom in our daily lives? A lot of writers, including myself, think that
				‘whom’ is a bit persnickety. Perhaps if we imagined ourselves living in
				Tudor England about the time of famous playwright Bill Shakespeare, whom
				might seem more like a ‘normal’ part of our everyday vocabulary.
				Illustration: Dominique Greene “To whom shall I send this letter today?
				Ah yes, ExemplaryEnglish.com.” I doth hear that they help many who
				seeketh help in grammar.” Who and whom can be quite tricky, but let’s
				break it down and find out how we can use these words appropriately. Who
				vs. Whom: Just when do we use them? Let’s talk about who and whom. How
				do we differentiate between the two? Who: Who is used as the subject of
				a verb or complement of a linking verb. It is a nominative (relating)
				pronoun. Example: Image: Camille Charles It was I who wrote the paper on
				Monday. Can you find the verbs? No scrolling down now….  : P Here’s a
				hint: a verb is an action or a state of being.  What is happening? Did
				you find them? Great! Now, find the subjects for each verb.   Hint: What
				is the sentence talking about? Who or what is the focus? Answers: The
				verbs are “was” and “wrote.” It was I who wrote the paper on Monday. The
				subjects are “I” and “who.” It was I who wrote the paper on Monday Whom:
				Whom is used as the object of the verb or the object of a preposition.
				Hence why it is an objective pronoun. Example: You asked whom to the
				dance tonight? The subject is you and the verb is asked.  The pronoun
				whom is following the verb and is the object of the verb; therefore,
				whom is a correct choice for this sentence. Be careful though. Make sure
				the prepositional pronoun in question isn’t also a subject—if it is,
				then you use who. Example: I cheered for who played hardest. While the
				pronoun follows a preposition (for), it’s also the subject of the second
				verb (played). When placed as a subject, always use who. In conclusion,
				remember these tips when in doubt: 1. When trying to decide whether who
				or whom is correct, simplify the sentence. It helps to move the words
				around in your head to identify the word relationships. For example:
				“Princess Peach and her ladies-in-waiting only invited people to their
				party [who or whom] they considered to love parties as much as they
				did.” The simplified mental version becomes: “whom they considered.”
				 (“whom” is correct) 2. The distinction between who and whom is less
				important in informal spoken language than it is in formal written
				language. (Formal language is used academically and professionally.)
				(Informal language is more casual and often contains slang and other
				common vernacular) Remember Fellow Writers…. There is much confusion and
				misuse on this topic. Just as correctly using whom may make others think
				that you are super smart, misusing it may make you seem a bit silly.
				Never use whom as a subject pronoun. This is as incorrect as using who
				where whom is required. Many people will mistakenly believe that you are
				trying to be formal. “Whom are you?” is wrong. It is meant to be “Who
				are you?” Happy Writing, EZ
